# This is how to be happier without really trying: 

Your brain is a time traveler: It projects into the past and future constantly and this can be an express ticket to regret and anxiety. Counteract it with mental distance to regain control.

Say your name: “I” creates problems. Eric thinks Eric should talk to Eric using “Eric.”

Get some mental distance: You can’t make the issue go away but you can broaden your perspective. A tablespoon of salt in a glass of water tastes awful, but a tablespoon of salt in a lake isn’t even noticeable.

Reframe: Your body often can’t tell anxiety from excitement so convert threats to challenges by reinterpreting your feelings.

你的大脑是一个时间旅行者：它不断地投射到过去和未来，这可能是一张通往后悔和焦虑的快票。用精神距离来抵消它，重新获得控制权。

说出你的名字：“我”会产生问题。埃里克认为埃里克应该用“埃里克”和埃里克说话

保持一定的心理距离：你不能让这个问题消失，但你可以拓宽你的视野。一杯水中的一汤匙盐尝起来很糟糕，但是湖中的一汤匙盐甚至看不见。

重构：你的身体经常分不清焦虑和兴奋，所以通过重新诠释你的感觉将威胁转化为挑战。

# Here’s how to make emotionally intelligent friendships: 

Stay in touch: Friendship is not an arena where you want to play hard to get. What are you, a carnival prize?

Gratitude: If we’re more kind to strangers than to friends, we are definitely doing something wrong.

Quality > Quantity: Share emotional experiences. That’s the secret to those friendships where you can just pick up where you left off.

Budget appropriately: Time is limited. Allocate it wisely. And this is yet another reason to ditch the jerks in your life.

How to party: Eat. Laugh. Reminisce. Avoid small talk. The more the merrier. (And maybe a bit of booze.)

Make your best friend better: You influence each other more than you know. Make yourself better and help make them better, because, in the end, those two are the same thing.

# This is how to have a long, awesome life :

Exercise is not natural. Neither is being sedentary. We did not evolve to move for no reason but we have been excellent at eliminating reasons. Not moving turns twenty-year-olds in forty-year-olds faster than… well, a lot faster than twenty years.

Mismatch Diseases: Many of the illnesses we attribute to age are not due to age. Live like someone lying in a hospital bed and you will soon be someone lying in a hospital bed.

Sitting, by itself, is not the problem: A standing desk at the office won’t do diddily if you’re endlessly planted on the couch at home every night.

How much? What kind?: At least 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise a week and weight train at least twice a week. Spend as much time worrying about “too much exercise” as you worry about the dilemma of having “too much money.”

Motivation: Create a good reason and socialize. Find something you enjoy doing or that you can attach an immediate reward to. Involve friends to add the lovely component of socializing (and for strategic guilt purposes).

# Timing matters. Here’s what to do: 

#睡眠

It’s not just blue light, it’s all light: Biology says when the sun goes down, you should too. Do the next best thing: kill overhead lights and dim everything else.

Your stomach is not an all-night diner: You want to be eating all your calories in less than half the day and none 3 hours before bed. Apparently, starving in the dark is good for you.

Be consistent: Sleeping in on the weekend means you’re doing it wrong during the week. Your physiology does not like an unpredictable schedule and it will seek vengeance.

The most important event of the day: Wake up, go outside, and get many many photons into your eyeballs.

Best time for brain work: 10AM to 3PM. And this reformed-night-owl writer now finds that’s when I really have a “way with words.” After 3PM, well, uh… not have way.

Exercise keeps the rhythm: Best time is after work but before dinner. If you have to work out late, use the shower trick.

# 如何追到你的男神/女神：

你难道只因为你理想中的男神或女神太难觅得，就打算同现在的另一半安顿下来吗？

Oliver Emberton在Quora（国外版知乎）上回答了你为什么不应该这么做，并解释了你如何才能得到你理想中的男孩儿或女孩儿。

想象一下当你的女神违心地对你说愿意同你在一起时的感受。

她的心里想着更好的人，但是他没法得到，所以她勉强的对你说愿意同你在一起。

感觉被轻视了？内心感觉很委屈？很可怜吧？那么就也别对别人这么做。

好的，那你想得到这个女神吗？

很有可能她并不是你想象的那个样子，但是那并不意味着这个过程毫无意义。它可能是使你所需要的警示。

最美妙也是最可怕的不公就是作为一个男人，你有巨大的可能去提升自己的吸引力。女人们更易受到外貌的评价，而男人们更多取决于他们是谁，有怎样的能力。

这对你来说是极好的消息，尤其是考虑到你现在的积极态度，提升的空间几乎是无穷的。

首先，忘掉要去追女神。

他们并没有那种让人不顾一切的吸引力，而你也需要将自己的注意力集中在别的地方。注意，那些最有魅力的男士们几乎从不主动追求他人。而那些最不吸引人的家伙们总是喋喋不休，摇尾乞怜。千万别成为他们中的一员。

现在你需要完成个人成长的任务来提高自己。这取决于你内心深层次的想法，但大体上讲你将要最大程度地提升自己的健康，财富，外貌，社交能力，并拓展一系列的兴趣爱好与技能。

这不是那种简单的20分钟健身运动，而是需要长期坚持培养的，如果你需要用到这些技能之一，就应该经历训练他们的辛苦历程。

一些例子：

	* 志愿者--献血/支教/搭建避难所
	* 上舞蹈课
	* 跳伞
	* 学习烹饪
	* 去能够改变人生的地方旅行（想象非洲而不是迪士尼乐园）
	* 参加一项运动，并逐渐掌握
	* 加入读书会
	* 学习身体语言和人类心理学
	* 寻找最好的媒体--音乐/电影/书籍--并开始深入理解他们
	* 学一个小魔术
	* 开家公司
	* 尝试公开演讲
	* 学习衣着得体
	* 为个良好动机开始存钱
	* 开始一项创造性的计划--比如录制短片或者写部短片小说
	* 学习一样乐器
	* 记账
	* 跑马拉松

做些激励别人的事儿。也做些激励自己的事儿。

你将会逐渐成为一个更好的人，更有吸引力。你的人生应该是实践伟大的誓言，而不是顾影自怜的哀鸣。

很有可能，你心中的女神实际上并不怎么样。你把她放在过于理想的位置上，而再能客观理性地把她当作普通人来对待了，而这种执着的念头将会使你感到失望。你需要将这些能量引导至其它地方。

你应该更加合理地利用这些能量使自己更有成就。你的人生由你书写，而最终英雄们总是能抱得美人归。

# 日程提升生活品质 

Here’s how to use rituals to improve your life:



Time is crazy. Internal time is what matters: You don’t judge your life as a collection of hours but as a collage of meaningful moments.

Rituals make time meaningful: “It is not a thing that lends significance to a moment; it is the moment that lends significance to things.” Intention. Attention. Repetition.

“Getting to work” rituals: Do something fun before you get started to get yourself in gear and you’ll reduce procrastination and perform better.

Try a secular sabbath: Take a time-out from the world and break the script. Novelty expands time and makes memories.

“Struggle” with friends: Board games and sports. Or work on something together. Ironically, giving time away makes you feel like you have more time (a fact that makes quantum mechanics seem logical by comparison.)

Mealtime rituals: Make dinner with loved ones special and memorable. Or combine it with some “struggle” and have a food fight. (C’mon, like that wouldn’t be memorable?)

# 理性表达否定

This is how to have emotionally intelligent disagreements:

Remember The Relationship: Enemies don’t say, “You are right. I am wrong.” Friends do.

De-Escalate: If your disputes sound even half as snarky as my writing, you’re doing it wrong.

Stop Trying To Control What They Think Or Feel: When their autonomy is threatened, people attack or shut down.

Help Them Make Their Argument Stronger: If you can’t disprove the best version of their argument, then you’re not “right”, you’re just playing tricks. And, more importantly, “steelmanning” shows you’re listening and that you’re sincere.

Disrupt The Script: Constructive conversations have ups and downs. Don’t escalate tension. Make a joke or say something positive.

Get Curious: So those aliens that talk to you, do they give good advice?

Help Them Question Their Own Thinking: Therapists don’t say: “That’s ridiculous. Where in your brain did the stroke occur for you to have an idea so stupid?” No, they ask questions until you start to question your own thinking and it crosses the blood-brain barrier that what you’ve been saying is the equivalent of 2+2=147.

# Here’s how to expand your mind’s abilities to get more done:

**Move**: Getting your body going gets your brain going. Try a standing desk. Go for walks when you need a break. Don’t be afraid to fidget. (And if this is all making sense to you it’s because I’m gesturing as I type.)
**Manipulate Your Environment**: Get a big monitor to leverage your visual system. And decorate. (Now you know how Martha Stewart accomplishes so much.)
**Get Out in Nature**: Go outside. Yes, that place you’ve heard about where the sun is. Or just look outside for 40 seconds. Yes, you can microdose Mother Nature.

# Here’s how to improve your personality:

**Extroversion: **Schedule more fun activities with friends. Forget what your parents said: talk to strangers. And if you get nervous, just remember: you’re not nervous; you’re excited.
**Openness:** Learn Chinese. Learn to cook. Learn to cook Chinese cuisine. And get some exercise. Lack of it is a major cause of a lousy personality.
**Conscientiousness: **You don’t need a fancy to-do list. You need more meaningful things in your life. Think about how what you do benefits others. And don’t try to increase willpower; eliminate temptations.
**Agreeableness: **Build those empathy muscles. To better understand others, better understand yourself. Think about the different sides of your personality. Then spend time with people very different from you.
**Neuroticism: **Turn your daily worry list into a nightly gratitude list. If you can do that for six months, reward yourself with a trip to Thailand.

以下是提高个性的方法：

外向：与朋友安排更多有趣的活动。忘掉你父母说的话：和陌生人谈谈。如果你紧张，请记住：你不紧张；你很兴奋。

开放性：学中文。学做饭。学习烹饪中国菜。锻炼一下。缺乏开放性是性格糟糕的主要原因。

认真：你不需要花哨的待办事项清单。你生活中需要更有意义的东西。想想你做的事情如何造福他人。不要试图增强意志力，消除诱惑。

和蔼可亲：培养那些移情肌肉。为了更好地了解他人，更好地了解自己。想想你性格的不同方面。然后花时间和和你非常不同的人在一起。

神经质：将您的日常担忧列表转换为每晚的感恩列表。如果你能这样做六个月，那就奖励自己去泰国旅行。

# 做理性父母

This is how to be an emotionally intelligent parent:

-   **The 4 Systems**: Playing dictator should be a last resort. (Orwell’s “Nineteen Eighty-Four” was not a parenting guide.) Deal with kids a lot more like you deal with adults – through influence, not demands.
-   **Ask “Who owns the problem?”**: You can teach problem-solving and get more free time for yourself with one fell swoop. Let kids own their problems. Be an advisor.
-   **When the kid owns the problem, use active listening**: Inigo Montoya recommends acceptance. Let them say how they feel, acknowledge those emotions and feed that back to them. If you don’t, all they’re going to hear is WA-WA-WA-WA. And then you will feel talking is pointless.
-   **When you own the problem, use “I” messages**: In a conflict discussion, any sentence that begins with “you” and does not end with “are so wonderful” will be perceived as a rhetorical cluster grenade. Neutrally state the behavior, say how it makes you feel, state the negative concrete effects on you. This will teach them to behave better because they care.

# This is the lazy way to an awesome life:

We need more awe: It brings us together and makes us feel like kids again. Good lord, it made college students put their phones down.
Momma Nature: Go for an awe walk. Or watch Blue Planet. (Whenever you hear David Attenborough’s voice, you are not far from awe.)
New Eyes: You are surrounded by miracles. Like your smartphone. Yes, you usually use that miracle to watch cat videos but a miracle is a miracle.
Find awe in other people: Gymnast George Eyser won six Olympic medals in one day, three of them gold. He had a wooden leg.
Gratitude: There was a moment in your childhood when you and your pals went out to play for the last time. And you didn’t know it. Good things end. And sometimes they never happen in the first place. You forget how lucky you are.


# Here’s how to get people to change:

-   **Nobody Likes To Be Told What To Do**: When we tell people what to do, they resist. Ask questions instead. Support “change talk.” Ignore “sustain talk.”
-   **Use “OARS”**: Ask open questions. Affirm their strengths. Lots of reflective listening. Summarize.
-   **Shift The Ratio Of Change Talk To Sustain Talk**: Ask questions that provoke DARN: Desire, Ability, Reasons and Need. This gets them focused on changing instead of sustaining.
-   **Develop Discrepancy**: Ask questions that evoke the discrepancy between their values and behavior.
-   **Evoke Hope**: Get them to reflect on previous successes in changing behavior. Get them to apply those lessons to the current issue.
-   **Planning**: Ask “So what’s next?” Use questions to get them to clarify and make a concrete plan. Summarize. Present possible challenges so they can troubleshoot and solidify the agenda.

如何让人们改变：

没有人喜欢被告知该做什么：当我们告诉人们该做什么时，他们会抵制。改为提问。支持“改变谈话”。忽略“持续谈话”。

使用“OARS”：提出开放式问题。肯定他们的长处。很多反思性倾听。总结一下。

Shift The Ratio Of Change Talk To Sustain Talk：提出引发DARN的问题：欲望、能力、原因和需求。这让他们专注于改变而不是持续。

培养差异：提出引发其价值观和行为之间差异的问题。

唤起希望：让他们反思以前在改变行为方面的成功。让他们把这些课程应用到当前的问题上。

规划：询问“接下来会发生什么？”使用问题让他们澄清并制定具体计划。总结一下。提出可能的挑战，以便他们能够对议程进行故障排除和巩固。

# Here’s how to find meaning in life: 
Belong to a group: I’ll be at lunch with Andy and the guys. Where will you be? 
Give your work purpose: You’re not emptying trash cans. You’re helping get a man on the moon. 
Craft your story: End it with redemption, not contamination, and become the superhero of your life. 
Transcendence: Nature is big. Your problems are small."

"Long-term career satisfaction requires traits like a real sense of autonomy, a real sense of impact on the world, a sense of mastery that you’re good at what you do, and a sense of connection in relation to other people."
